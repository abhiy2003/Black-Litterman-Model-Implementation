# Black-Litterman-Model-Implementation

This is an implementation of the Black-Litterman portfolio allocation model and its application to optimizing asset allocation among 11 sector-level ETFs with given historical market data and sentiment-driven investor views and confidences. The code prints out the daily allocation weights vs. the market weights, and also daily portfolio statistics such as its return vs. the market return, its Sharpe ratio, and its volatility. The output also includes final portfolio statistics including its total cumulative returns vs. the market's total cumulative returns and its Sharpe ratio, volatility, Beta, and Alpha over the test period of January 3rd, 2023 to June 28th, 2024. The portfolio statistics are saved to an Excel file. The monthly average of the daily optimal portfolio allocation percentage for each ETF is plotted as a stacked bar graph, the standard deviation of daily allocation weights by ETF is plotted as a bar graph, and the portfolio's and market's respective cumulative returns over the test period are both plotted on a line graph for comparison.
